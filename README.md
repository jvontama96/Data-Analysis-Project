<p>Growlab is an end-to-end platform from Indonesia that helps businesses and small enterprises grow and increase revenue through programs such as training, mentorship, services, and evaluations.</p>
<p>As a Data Analyst at Growlab, I process data directly from app.datapinter.com, which includes product data from various e-commerce platforms like Shopee, Tokopedia, and TikTok. My main focus is analyzing products on the Shopee platform, which consists of thousands of rows of data. I deliver presentation decks with insights twice a week to Growlab members.</p>
